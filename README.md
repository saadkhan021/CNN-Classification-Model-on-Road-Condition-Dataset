# CNN-Classification-Model-on-Road-Condition-Dataset
One of the most critical (and underrated) parts of any AI project is dataset creation. Before touching any model, I focused on designing a dataset that actually represents the real-world problem.  🔹 Dataset Overview  For this project, I created a custom image dataset specifically designed for road-related object and condition analysis.
