# CNN-Classification-Model-on-Road-Condition-Dataset
End-to-End Data Mining + Computer Vision Project (From Dataset to Deployment)
🔹 Project Objective

To analyze and detect road-related objects/conditions using Computer Vision, supported by Data Mining techniques, and deploy it as a usable application.
One of the most critical (and underrated) parts of any AI project is dataset creation. Before touching any model, I focused on designing a dataset that actually represents the real-world problem.

After preparing the dataset, I moved toward building a complete intelligent system combining deep learning models and an interactive UI.

🔹 Dataset Overview

For this project, I created a custom image dataset specifically designed for road-related object and condition analysis.

🔹 Types of Data Used

📷 Image data (RGB images)

Real-world scenarios collected and organized manually

Preprocessed using resizing, normalization, and augmentation

🔹 Models Used

🧠 CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Used for image classification

Learns spatial and visual patterns

Built and trained using TensorFlow / Keras

🎯 YOLO (You Only Look Once)

Used for real-time object detection

Detects multiple objects in a single frame

Optimized for speed and accuracy

🔹 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Dataset creation & preprocessing
2️⃣ Data augmentation & splitting
3️⃣ CNN model training and evaluation
4️⃣ YOLO-based object detection
5️⃣ Performance analysis and tuning
6️⃣ Integration of models into an application

🔹 Deployment & UI

🖥️ Streamlit was used to build an interactive web interface where:

Users can upload images

See predictions and detections in real time

Visualize results easily without technical complexity

🔹 Key Learnings

✔️ Model selection depends on the problem, not trends
✔️ Data preprocessing plays a major role in accuracy
✔️ Deployment is as important as model training

This project helped me understand how research ideas turn into real applications.

📌 Still improving, experimenting, and learning — feedback is always welcome!
